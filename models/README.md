# Model definitions

Model metadata is organized as:

```text
models/<llm-or-vlm>/<model-id>/<platform>/<quantization>.env
```

LLM definitions download one `.rkllm` file. VLM definitions download a paired
`.rkllm` language model and `.rknn` vision encoder for the same platform.

An LLM definition contains:

```dotenv
MODEL_URL=https://example.com/Qwen3-4B_RK3576_w8a8.rkllm
MODEL_FILE=Qwen3-4B_RK3576_w8a8.rkllm
RKLLM_TOOLKIT_VERSION=1.2.3
MODEL_SHA256=optional-lowercase-sha256
```

A complete VLM definition contains both model artifacts and the vision runtime
settings:

```dotenv
MODEL_KIND=vlm
MODEL_URL=https://example.com/Qwen3.5-4B_RK3576_w8a8.rkllm
MODEL_FILE=Qwen3.5-4B_RK3576_w8a8.rkllm
VISION_MODEL_URL=https://example.com/Qwen3.5-4B_vision_RK3576.rknn
VISION_MODEL_FILE=Qwen3.5-4B_vision_RK3576.rknn
RKLLM_TOOLKIT_VERSION=1.3.0
MODEL_SHA256=optional-lowercase-sha256
VISION_MODEL_SHA256=optional-lowercase-sha256
```

`MODEL_FILE` and `VISION_MODEL_FILE` must exactly match the final filename in
their corresponding URL. The converted artifacts in this repository put the
platform before the quantization, for example:

```text
Qwen3-4B_RK3576_w8a8.rkllm
Qwen3.5-4B_RK3576_w8a8.rkllm
Qwen3.5-4B_vision_RK3576.rknn
```

Do not use the older form where the platform appears after the quantization,
such as `Qwen3-4B_w8a8_RK3576.rkllm`.

The runtime selects 2 RKNN cores for RK3576 and 3 for RK3588/RK3588S from
`TARGET_PLATFORM`. The `.rkllm` and `.rknn` files must target the same platform.

`RKLLM_TOOLKIT_VERSION` records the toolkit used to create the `.rkllm` file.
`MODEL_URL` and `VISION_MODEL_URL` must be direct download URLs, such as
Hugging Face `/resolve/main/...` URLs. Model binaries are downloaded during
the image build and are not committed to Git.

## Build model images

Use **Actions → Build model images**:

- `scope: configuration` builds one selected quantization and platform;
- `scope: model` builds every definition for one model;
- `scope: all` scans and builds every definition under `models/`;
- `platform: all` builds the selected quantization on every available platform.

For private or temporary artifacts, provide the URL override in the workflow
and configure `MODEL_DOWNLOAD_TOKEN` as a repository secret when needed.

Published images use separate namespaces and `<platform>-<quantization>` tags:

```text
ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>/llm/<model-id>:rk3576-w4a16
ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>/vlm/<model-id>:rk3576-w4a16-g128
```
